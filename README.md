# US-Gun-Violence-Analysis
## 1. Introduction
I decided to discover the Gun Violence dataset in the US from Kaggle. This data  provides a detailed record of over 260,000 gun violence incidents in US during the period 2013-2018. Each entry contains comprehensive information about individual incidents, including location, date, casualties, and contributing factors. This dataset is formed by data scientists and statisticians who would like to research/analyze/understand better Gun Violence, making data-driven predictions about future trends in gun violence. The data set is downloaded at the link:  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jameslko/gun-violence-data
## 2. Data Collection: 
As the link describes, the data is collected from public records of gun violence incidents in the United States. These records include police reports, newspaper articles, and official government sources, ensuring a reliable and diverse representation of incidents. The dataset compiles information such as date, location, number of casualties, and specific details about the individuals involved, including demographic information where available. It also categorizes incidents by factors such as type of gun violence (e.g., mass shooting, domestic violence) and contributing circumstances. The rigorous collection methodology ensures a broad and accurate dataset, making it a valuable resource for exploring gun violence patterns and trends over a five-year period.

## 3. Data Limitations
While this dataset provides a comprehensive overview of gun violence in Us from 2013 to 2018, but It still has limitations such as: 

1. Incomplete Reporting: Some incidents may not have been reported or included due to variations in data collection methods across different sources, potentially leading to under representation of specific cases. 

2. Temporal Limitations and timeless: The dataset covers incidents between 20013-2018. We can provide a detailed picture of gun violence in the US during this period. Of course, it can be used to predict future incidents, but it has limitations in understanding the current trends or predicting future incidents. 

3. Missing or Inconsistent Data: Certain variables, such as demographic details or contributing factors, may be incomplete or inconsistently reported, which could affect the accuracy of detailed analysis. 

4. Geographic Bias: Data may be disproportionately collected from areas with higher media coverage or more detailed reporting infrastructure, potentially skewing results. 

5. Lack of Context: While the dataset captures incident details, it may lack broader contextual information such as socioeconomic factors, local laws, or historical trends, which are critical for a more nuanced analysis.
